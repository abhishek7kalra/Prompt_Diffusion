This model was build via parameter-efficient QLoRA finetuning of [Mistral-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) on a custom dataset.
The goal of this project is to build a model which takes simple and short natural language inputs and generate a highly detailed and descriptive prompt for [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-diffusion) and other similar image generation models.
Hence making it easier for everyone to get high quality images easily.

## Note

>This is the first iteration of this project and it was to check the capabilities of Mistral-7B model.
>As of now the model is fine-tuned mostly on the prompts which includes humans, with description of the subject and the scene.
>This is a work in progress and this is just a prototype. Hence, one can expect issues with response from the model.

## Input Template

```
###Human:
generate a stable diffusion prompt for {input}

###Assistant:
```

## Output Template

```
###Human:
generate a stable diffusion prompt for a model in a cafe sipping coffee

###Assistant:
A model in a cafe sipping coffee, with a warm glow illuminating her face. She wears a stylish dress and has a book in her hand. The background is a cozy cafe with dim lights.
```

## Example prompts and responses

Example 1: 

**User**:

>a model in a cafe sipping coffee

**Prompt Diffusion**

>A model in a cafe sipping coffee, with a warm glow illuminating her face.
She wears a stylish dress and has a book in her hand. The background is a cozy cafe with dim lights.

<br>

Example 2: 

**User**:

>a man skiing

**Prompt Diffusion**

>A man in a ski suit, with a helmet and goggles, is skiing down a snowy mountain, with the wind blowing in his face and the sun shining brightly. 
The man is enjoying the thrill of skiing, as he glides down the slopes, leaving behind a trail of fresh powder.

<br>

Example 3: 

**User**:

>a beautiful woman dancing in rain

**Prompt Diffusion**

>A beautiful woman, dressed in a flowing white gown, dances gracefully in the rain. 
The raindrops fall gently around her, creating a magical and ethereal atmosphere. 
She moves with grace and elegance, her long hair flowing in the wind. 
The rain creates a shimmering effect on her gown, making her look like a goddess.

<br>

Example 4: 

**User**:

>a man on a beach

**Prompt Diffusion**

>A man sits on a beach, the waves crashing against the shore.
The sun is setting, casting a warm glow over the sand and water.
The man is lost in thought, his mind wandering as he takes in the beauty of the scene.
